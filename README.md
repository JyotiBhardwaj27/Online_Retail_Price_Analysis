# **Online Retail Price Analysis Dashboard📊🛒**

## **🎯 Aim**

The aim of this project is to develop an interactive Power BI report that provides actionable insights into retail product pricing across major e-commerce platforms like **Amazon**, **Flipkat**, and **etc**. By leveraging web scraping, data cleaning, and data visualization, the goal is to analyze competitor pricing strategies and provide a comprehensive pricing overview.

## **📋 Objectives of the Project**

1. Develop an intuitive and interactive Power BI dashboard.
2. Improve data visualization for better understanding of pricing trends.
3. Perform competitor analysis across e-commerce platforms.
4. Provide filtering and drill-through options for deeper insights.

## **🛠 Tools and Technologies Used**

1. **Dataset Used:** Online Retail Product Data (scraped from Amazon and Flipkart).
2. **Data Handling:** Python (using Pandas, Selenium).
3. **Visualization:** Power BI.

## **🛠 Installation & Setup**

1. Install **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Download and open the `Online_Retail_Price_Analysis.pbix` file.
3. Ensure all data connections are configured.
4. Refresh the report to view the latest pricing insights.

3. **Competitor Analysis:** Visualizes price comparison for informed decisions.
4. **Data Accuracy:** Cleaned data ensures reliable insights.
5. **Advanced Filtering:** Slicers and drill-through features enhance analysis.

## **❗ Challenges Faced**

1. **Data Integration Issues:** Merging scraped data from different platforms.
2. **Performance Optimization:** Handling large datasets in Power BI.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Normalizing product names and filling missing data.

## **✅ Conclusion**

The Online Retail Price Analysis Dashboard successfully showcases how Python and Power BI can be used for real-time pricing analysis. The dashboard provides actionable insights for businesses to make data-driven pricing decisions. Future improvements could involve adding predictive analytics and incorporating additional data sources for a broader analysis.
